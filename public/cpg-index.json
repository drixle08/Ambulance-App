      "text": "Message from the CEO Dear Colleagues The delivery of high - quality evidence - based healthcare is essential for improving patient outcomes and ensuring the best possible clinical practice as part of our drive to be a world leading high performing ambulance service, including in both access and effectiveness. These Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG’s) have been developed to provide you with clear, up to date, and practical recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and management of a range of conditions faced in the prehospital setting. The purpose of these HMCAS Clinical Practice Guidelines is to: • Aim to support clinical staff in making informed decisions while also promoting consistency in care across diverse health care settings • Provide a common clinical practice framework for clinical staff from different healthcare systems • Ensure consistent application of evidence, latest scientific research, best practice, clinical trials and expert opinion - based clinical management. • Provide guidance to facilitate individual patient needs when it comes to decision making for infrequently encountered or complex clinical conditions. • Facilitate a defence against alleged malpractice."

      "text": "The Guidelines reflect a patient centered and practical approach and where appropriate, link in with receiving hospital treatment pathways. The CPGs cannot cover all eventualities encountered within the complex and dynamic environment of prehospital care. Safety – Benefit – Effectiveness trade - offs have to be made on a daily basis. At times, clinicians will have to undertake care for conditions not covered or use available tools and techniques for situations beyond the published guidelines. The guiding principle for those situations is to provide safe and effective patient care by concentrating on core patient outcomes: • Saving and preserving of life • Relieving suffering • Facilitate safe transfer to a specialist center or hospital • Maximizing recovery from critical injury or illness"

Best Practice Guidelines are an essential aspect of effective clinical governance, and these Clinical Practice Guidelines form the corner stone of evidence - based practice, clinical audit, pathway review and pathway development. For the Ambulance Service to learn , feedback from clinical practice is required. Clinicians have a professional responsibility to highlight deviations and situations not covered by the CPGs to the medical directorate for the organisation to review its practice and adapt. Ambulance Paramedics remain the backbone of the ambulance service, providing care in all patient contacts. The Clinical Guidelines address the vast majority of patient contacts, where prehospital intervention is required to be performed by an ambulance par amedic. Should a deviation from the clinical Guidelines be required, wherever possible, the attending Ambulance Paramedic should discuss the patient’s needs with the Clinical Coordinator based within the National Command Centre.

They will face clinical situations that cannot be predicted and may have to, on occasions, act outside of these published guidelines to manage a patie nt according to the principles mentioned above. The wealth of experience, within our staff, remains essential to optimising patient outcomes and therefore our clinical guidelines outline variations in clinical practice between Ambulance Paramedics and Crit ical Care Paramedics.

      "text": "Message from the Medical Director Over the past years, and since publishing the last version of the HMC Ambulance Service (HMC AS) clinical practice guidelines, much has happened to the service. In order to respond to rising clinical need within the State of Qatar, the service has grown in size and has diversified into specialized spheres of operations. In order to maintain the appropriate response to calls, by either the public or the various medical facilities, the service now has more hubs, spokes and clinical units to accommodate the wi dest spectrum of clinical need. HMC AS’ clinical staff is the greatest asset the service has, therefore maintaining HMC AS clinicians’ professional standing through appropriate guidance, training and education is of the highest importance. To that end, this latest version of HMC AS’ clin ical practice guidelines has been developed to support that theme. These guidelines are based on the latest evidence and best practice in the pre - hospital field. They have been updated through review of the latest published evidence and the learning from t he HMC AS’ clinical frontline. Finally, HMC AS clinicians should view these guidelines as clinical interv"

During the first trimester, the blood plasma increases by 15% and peaks at 50% above the normal (32 weeks). CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM The heart enlarges due to an increase in blood volume and increase in cardiac output. The heart rate increases up to 25% by the end of the second trimester. Pressure on the diaphragm displaces the heart upwards, rotating it forwards and displaced laterally. Due to the placenta acting as arteriovenous shunt and peripheral vasodilatio n, systolic blood pressure may drop slightly (6 - 8%) with a more marked drop in diastolic blood pressure during the first two trimesters. The following ECG changes occur during pregnancy (no clinical significance): • Sinus tachycardia with atrial and ventricular ectopics • ST segment depression and t - wave inversion in the inferior and lateral leads RESPIRATORY SYSTEM The upper respiratory tract becomes more vascular with oedema and hyperaemia developing in the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea and bronchi.

Functional residual capacity decreases by 20 - 30%. Anatom ical and physiological changes in both the cardiovascular and respiratory system causes a general feeling of breathlessness particular on slight exertion but also consider underlying pulmonary effects of cardiovascular disease. UTERUS The uterus changes from an initial weight of roughly 70g (10ml) to a term weight of 1.1kg (5L). The perfusion of the placenta is dependent on maternal circulation to the uterus and as the uterus increase in size blood flow increases rapidly. The total increase in blo od flow to the uterus is up to twenty times normal. By the end of pregnancy, about a sixth of the maternal blood volume is within the uterine circulation. ▪ BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS ▪ BACK TO FORMULARY"

APO is generally categorised as cardiogenic or non - cardiogenic. Majority of the APO patients seen by HMCAS are cardiogenic in origin . However, management is similar for the two. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Acute Pulmonary Oedema may present with the following: • Dyspnoea & Tachypnoea • Diaphoresis • Anxiety • Crackles on ausc ultation – usually heard at the bases, progressing to apices as APO worsens • Cough • Tachycardia • Hypertension • Hypotension (cardiogenic shock) ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS • Blood pressure is a key indicator as to the drug therapy regime to be used when managing these patients. • Assess the ankles, abdomen, and neck for signs of systemic fluid overload. • Detailed history taking and assessment are important in order to identify the possible cause of APO. Differentiating between cardiogenic ( e. g. ACS, renal failure) and non - cardiogenic ( e. g. sepsis, tox ins) will guide treatment. Identify and treat potential underlying causes.

A small fluid bolus (250 - 500ml) may be administered cautiously. Inotropic/vasopressor support may be required. • Increase PEEP and Psupport SLOWLY to a maximum PEEP of 15 mbar and a combined PEEP and Psupport of 20mbar . • Do not fix the CPAP mask to the patient until the patient is comfortable. • Nebulising an APO patient with Salbutamol has been shown to be harmful. Patients presenting with respiratory distress , including wheezing , hypertension, and NO history of asthma /COPD , indicating probable APO, should NOT be nebulised. • For those patients who are significantly hypertensive, consider starting the GTN infusion at a higher dose . • Movement of critically hypoxic patients may result in a worsening of their condition.

The opening in the neck, known as the stoma, can be either permanent or temporary. Patients that have had a partial laryngectomy may still have a patent upper airway, whereas patients that have had a total laryngectomy will not have a patent upper airway and the trachea has been revised to the front of the neck. There are various types of tracheostomy tubes that you may encounter, mainly single or double lumen tubes; cuffed or uncuffed tubes; and fenestrated or adjustable tubes. Patients experiencing a life - threatening emergency related to a tracheostomy include either a partial/complete obstruction or a partial/complete dislodgement of the tracheostomy tube. Paramedics should rapidly identify the type of tracheostomy emergency and intervene as required.

Non - traumatic shock can be categorised into hypovolaemic, cardiogen ic, obstructive, septic and anaphylactic shock. For the management of ca rdiogenic, septic and anaphylactic shock, see relevant CPG. Hypovolemic shock is caused by dehydration due to severe vomiting, diarrhoea, exposure to high temperatures and reduced fluid intake or non - traumatic causes of blood loss ( e.g. obstetric emergenc ies) . Obstructive shock is due to severe bronchospasm or airway obstruction with significant air trapping causing an increase in intrathoracic pressure and compression of the heart, reducing venous return and thus cardiac output. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Patients experiencing non - traumatic shock may present with the following: • Hypotension • Tachycardia • B radyca rdia • Pallor • Respiratory distress • Altered LOC • As well as signs and symptoms associated with the underlying cause of shock ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS • Identify, if possible, the underlying cause of shock and treat appropriately. • Regularly assess perfusion status to determine"

Crush injuries are ca tegorised into three types: Crush injury – localised tissue injury as a result of prolonged compressive force applied to an area of the body, most commonly limbs. Compartment syndrome – increased pressure within a muscle, due to the non - elastic nature of the fascia, leading to reduced circulation distal to the injury. Tissue ischemia and necrosis can occur if left untreated. Crush syndrome – the systemic manifestation of crush injury, as a result of tissue destruction. This results in the destruction of myocytes and release of myoglobin, potassium and uric acid upon reperfusion. Further deterioration into rhabdomyolysis can occur, leading t o hypovolaemia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis and acute kidney failure, leading to death.

Renal dialysis patients are encountered in both the Emergency and Scheduled Ambulance Services and clinicians should be able to recognize and manage complications associated with renal dialysis. ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS • Haemodialysis : o Haemodialysis involves blood being pumped from the body through special tubing into a dialysis machine from a surgically inserted catheter or arterio - venous fistula. The dialysis machine removes waste products and excess fluid from the blood, acting as a t ype of artificial kidney. Blood passes through a dialyser (filter), which also assists in balancing fluid, minerals and chemicals in the blood.

The primary aim of the SAS is to provide holistic and social care to patients requiring safe transportation. As such , these patients are a diverse group with unique needs that differ from the Emergency Ambulance Service group. Consent should be obtained prior to performing any assessments unless the assessment is part of emergency care where consent is implied. ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS • Many SAS crews will develop close professional relationships with their patients as they will interact with them on a daily basis. However, Standard and Environmental Precautions (see SOP 2.1) should be adhered to. • With the exception of patients listed below, SAS are not required to complete a routine assessment of vital signs during transportation as this reflects the holistic and social needs of the patient as well as patient feedback received during patient engage ment sessions.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION Confirmed/suspected COVID - 19 patients with hypoxaemia/respiratory distress may present with the following : • Dyspnoea • Tachypnoea • Low SpO 2 • Tachycardia ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS • It is important to note that despite presenting with critical hypoxaemia, COVID - 19 patients may present without proportional signs of respiratory distress ( e.g. have critically low SpO2 but no associated obvious respiratory distress). • Monitor patients closely. Monitoring requirements include heart rate (4 - lead ECG) , respiratory rate (use EtCO 2 device), blood pressure, SpO 2 and temperature. • Consider nebulisation for patients presenting with wheezes that are KNOWN to have asthma/COPD. SPECIAL NOTES • Wash and disinfect your hands regularly. • Wear PPE (N95 mask, face shield, gloves and gown ). • Practice social cleaning of your vehicle and equipment regularly. • Minimize the number of staff"
